The React Support Ticket Management System is a web application built using React.js, Firebase Authentication, and Firestore to create a seamless platform for managing customer support tickets. The system features two distinct user roles: Customers and Support Agents. Customers can create, view, and delete their own tickets, while Support Agents have the ability to view all tickets, update their statuses, and assign tickets but cannot delete them. The application includes a secure login page utilizing Firebase Authentication and a support dashboard displaying all tickets in a structured format, with actions such as "View," "Edit," and "Delete." Customers can submit new tickets via a modal form, which includes 12+ fields, such as text inputs, dropdowns, checkboxes, date selectors, and file uploads, with proper form validation. Role-based access controls ensure users can only access functionalities relevant to their roles. The app uses the NextUI Dashboard Template for a modern and clean user interface, ensuring an intuitive user experience. Finally, the project is deployable on Firebase, Vercel, or Netlify for easy access and management.
